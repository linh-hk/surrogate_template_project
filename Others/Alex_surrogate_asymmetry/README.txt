Example of system where making surrogates of X gives substantially
different behavior than making surrogates of Y.

Here, a Lorenz system (y) drives a logistic map (x), and cross-map skill 
uses x to predict y. 

To run example, enter the following into the command line:

python3 lorenz_example.py

The output is printed to the console.
Runtime is about 8 minutes.
A record of the output is in 'output.txt'
